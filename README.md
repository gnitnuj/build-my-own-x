# Collection of build-your-own-x projects

Instead of creating new repositories, the plan is to keep them all in this single mono repo.

## Projects

### Done, done

- [google-drive-clone](https://github.com/gnitnuj/google-drive-clone)
- [monkey-lang-interpreter](https://github.com/gnitnuj/monkey-lang-interpreter)

### Core functionality done, but mulling over some expansion ideas

- [svelte-vercel-llm-chat](https://github.com/gnitnuj/build-my-own-x/tree/main/svelte-vercel-llm-chat)

### Just getting started

- [one-billion-checkboxes](https://github.com/gnitnuj/build-my-own-x/tree/main/one-billion-checkboxes)

### Ideation Stage

- Replace my current Zapier pipeline with local server + LLM (Gmail -> Income/Expense Data Extraction -> Quickbooks)
- Chrome Extension to gamify Google Suite. e.g. Arkanoid in Google Calendar breaking events to unattend meetings
- Build and deploy a Flutter app to Android and iOS
  - App to let people know when you're in town. basically pub/sub + travel calendar + location services
- Library of silly UI elements. e.g. submit button drops to bottom of view on mouseover (with physics)
- AI Chatbot that only offers absolutely terrible advice. i.e. LLM guardrails where the normal, responsible answer is guarded against
